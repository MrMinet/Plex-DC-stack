# Plex-DC-stack
A complete Plex stack made with Docker-Compose

A docker-compose file to create simple docker stack with Plex, QBitorrent, Jacket, Sonarr, Radarr and Ombi.

More to come : 
- NetData for server monitoring
- Tautulli for Plex monitoring


Made with help from this link https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/#Sonarr_8211_TV_Show_Download_and_Management
You can easily add desired container to the docker-compose file, or change Plex for Emby or any other Media Player
